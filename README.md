Cast Away is a 2000 American survival drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Tom Hanks as a FedEx troubleshooter who is stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific. The film, released on December 22, 2000, grossed $429 million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2000.

## Overview
In December 1995, FedEx systems analyst Chuck Noland is called away to resolve a problem in Malaysia, causing tension in his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears. During a Christmas dinner, Chuck receives a box containing an engagement ring from Kelly, which he believes is an engagement ring. Chuck crashes into the Pacific Ocean during a storm, and is the only survivor. He struggles to find food and water, and tries to escape on a life raft but is prevented by the tide. He opens most of the packages, but fails to open a package with pink angel wings. After a bloodstained handprint, Chuck decides to perform his own tooth extraction. Four years later, he adapts to life alone on the island and successfully rescues Wilson, who falls off the raft. He is later declared dead by his family and friends. Chuck returns the angel-winged package to its sender in Texas, but finds no one home. He encounters a woman who gives him directions to the house, but is unsure of the way to go.

### Quote
I made Cast Away because I wanted to examine the concept of four years of hopelessness, in which you have none of the requirements for living—food, water, shelter, fire and company. But it took us six years to put together the alliance that would actually examine that. I only had a third of it, and Bill Broyles only had a third of it, until Bob Zemeckis comes along and provided that other third. I had that original idea. I was reading an article about FedEx, and I realized that 747s filled with packages fly across the Pacific three times a day. And I just thought, "What happens if that goes down?"
